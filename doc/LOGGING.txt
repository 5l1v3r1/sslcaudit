Logging strategy
================

The tool uses logging facility to convey information about the progress of the test.
There is a log file in the filebag directory which contains full debug info.
In normal mode it displays informational-level messages to the console (to be changed for GUI probably).
In quiet mode it will only display warnings and other higher level messages. In any non-zero debug mode
it will display debug messages to the console.
