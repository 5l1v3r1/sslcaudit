The goal of sslcaudit project is to develop a tool for off-line MITM testing
of any SSL/TLS clients (not necessary HTTPS), suitable for professional use.
I am tired of messing around with openssl and socat and want a tool which makes
security audits of SSL clients (thick clients, mobile devices, appliances, etc)
less labor-intensive.

See doc/ folder for more information or run 'sslcaudit -h' option.
